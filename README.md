## Marketplace(Bolockchain Develop position)
[Create a token]
I mint a token, and transfer to market
I -0.01 market fee, but set 0.05 price
M Recieve this token
M +0.01 market fee

[Purchase a token]
Z purchase this token, paid 0.05
M transfer this token to Z, transfer 0.01 market fee to Owner
M Recieve 0.05, transfer 0.05 purchase fee to I(Seller)
